# Tugas-2-Comprehensive-Analysis-on-Carbon-Dioxide-Levels-and-Climate-Change

Instruction
In this assignment, you will dive into various aspects of Data Science and Machine Learning, ranging from Descriptive and Inferential Statistics to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and Statistical Modeling using Supervised and Unsupervised Learning.

Dataset
Download the dataset on carbon dioxide levels from NASA's Climate Change Data Portal.
The dataset should contain columns for Year, CO2 Levels, and potentially other climate-related variables.

Part 1: Descriptive Statistics - Masic Measures
Compute the mean, median, and standard deviation for CO2 Levels.

Part 2: Exploratory Data Analysis with Python I - Univariate Analysis
Visualize the distribution of CO2 Levels through plots like histograms or density plots.

Part 3: Exploratory Data Analysis with Python II - Bivariate Analysis
Investigate the relationship between Year and CO2 Levels using scatter plots, line plots, or correlation matrices.

Part 4: Supervised Learning - Regression - Simple Linear Regression
Perform a simple linear regression using Year as the independent variable and CO2 Levels as the dependent variable.

Part 5: Unsupervised Learning - K-Means Clustering
If there are other climate-related variables in the dataset, use K-Means clustering to categorize years into different climate profiles.
